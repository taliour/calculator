# calculator
A simple calculator made using HTML CSS and JavaScript. I used flexbox for the UI and vanila javascript for the code. The user either input numbers and operators through the UI or use keyboard. Although they are not yet on the UI,the user can also backspace to correct a mistake and add decimal numbers without problem. If you encounter any bugs or have any questions contanct me.
